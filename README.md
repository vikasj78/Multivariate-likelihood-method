# Multivariate-likelihood-method
This method was developed for the core and energy estimation of particle air-showers obeserved by HAWC gamma-ray observatory. It is currently being used as the default method for the HAWC gamma-ray observatory. The publication on this is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07227.

As this novel method is not only limited to only HAWC gamma-ray observatory it can be used for any particle detector array. It is a candidate method for the future SWGO gamma-ray observatory. A master thesis in my co-supervision shows the first results for the SWGO gamma-ray observatory here: https://ecap.nat.fau.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_MA_Leitl.pdf.
